## Study Area and Data Collection

The study area, Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, or referred to as Tibetan Plateau, is situated in the western region of China and characterized by its high altitude averaging over 4,000 meters. Due to its low population density and an extremely alpine climate, it exhibits a unique set of travel behavioral patterns for local residents or outside tourists. Furthermore, in recent years, the plateau has witnessed rapid infrastructural development invested by Chinese government, and a significant surge in tourist influx [@Gao2021]. Despite this growth, scholarly investigations into travel behaviors, satisfaction levels, and the broader implications of these developments on local and visiting populations remain scant.

The questionnaire-collecting process started both online and on-site in July of 2022. The online questionnaires were written on the cover page that only those who had ever been to Qinghai-Tibet Plateau were qualified to fill out them. Then followed by was the on-site questionnaire-distributing process along with the Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Program during late July to early August. To specifically target at tourists while considering the convenience of conducting investigation, we mainly chose four touristic sites to collect questionnaires along the expedition route. Eventually, we collected 729 on-site questionnaires, which were acquired mostly in four sites - Qinghai Province Museum in Xining City, Qinghai Lake Scenic Area, Dachaidan Emerald Lake Scenic Area, Mani Stone Mound Scenic Area in Yushu City (Figure \ref{fig:SampleLocations}). With a total number of 830 questionnaires, 16 were filtered out due to a lot of missing answers, leaving 814 eventually entering modeling phase, with an validity rate of 98.07%.

## Variables

The survey was originally designed in the contexts of assessing smart transportation within the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, which contains multifaceted aspects spanning from travel behavior, travel perceptions to technology adoption and usage. This study focuses only on several key dimensions, which are tourist travel behavior, their perceived travel environment, travel satisfaction, and their socio-demograpical characteristics.

The complete questionnaire (originally in Chinese and translated in English) alongside with data cleaning and re-digitalizing is stored in `TravelBehaviorQinghaiData` [package](https://github.com/Horan517/TravelBehaviorQinghaiData).

Specifically, socio-demograpical variables include gender, age, residence, personal monthly income, education level, profession, household size and ownership of driving license. Travel behavior variables in this model include frequency of traveling to Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in the past year and average daily traveling distance during the trip people were having when filling the questionnaire. Travel expectation and travel satisfaction are also measured, using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from strongly agree (value = 5) to strongly disagree (value = 1). Lastly, travel environment variables include two latent variables - people's perceptions of the environment of tourist attractions and the environment of roads along the trip, with the first consisting of 6 questions and the latter consisting of 5 questions.

## Methodology

Structural Equation Model (SEM) was used in the study to entangle the complex relationships across different variables. According to @Bollen1989, SEM is able to simultaneously estimate the causal relationships among a set of observed variables based on a specified model. In addition, SEM can calculate the indirect effects between two variables, mediated by other intervening variables [@Hayes2009], which would help unravel the mediating effects of perceived travel environment had on travel satisfaction through travel behavior.

## Model Construction

The conceptual framework of SEM model is shown in Figure \ref{fig:}. Both direct and indirect pathways are drawn and measured, but only one model - a single-group model consisting of all observations, is measured in this model paper. A multi-group modelling approach (setting residence as a grouping variable) was previously used to compare the differences between local tourists and non-local tourists in the project. But in this model paper due to time constraints I did not incoporate the multi-group modelling analysis.

## Modeling

```{r, include = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
# packages needed

remotes::install_github("Horan517/TravelBehaviorQinghaiData")

if (!requireNamespace("lavaan", quietly = TRUE)) {
    install.packages("lavaan")
}

if (!requireNamespace("kableExtra", quietly = TRUE)) {
    install.packages("kableExtra")

```

```{r, include = FALSE}

```{r, include = FALSE}
# load dataset

Below, confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) model and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) model are respectively defined and measured.

```{r warning = TRUE, results = "hide", tidy = TRUE}
# Define the CFA model
cfa_model <- '
# Measurement model
tourist_envi =~ ta_envi1 + ta_envi2 + ta_envi3 + ta_envi4 + ta_envi5 + ta_envi6
road_envi =~ r_envi1 + r_envi2 + r_envi3 + r_envi4 + r_envi5
'

# Fit the model
fit_cfa <- cfa(cfa_model, data = TBQT, missing = "ml")

# Model summary
cfa_summary <- summary(fit_cfa, fit.measures = TRUE, standardized = TRUE)
print(cfa_summary)
```

```{r, warning = FALSE, results = "hide", tidy = TRUE}
# Define the SEM model

# Measurement model
tourist_envi =~ ta_envi1 + ta_envi2 + ta_envi3 + ta_envi4 + ta_envi5 + ta_envi6
road_envi =~ r_envi1 + r_envi2 + r_envi3 + r_envi4 + r_envi5

# Structural model

daily_d ~ gender + age + residence + income + edu_lvl + profession + household_size + dri_lic + num_cars + exp_lvl + self_drive + other_drive + pub_trans + bicycle + walking + tourist_envi + road_envi

sati_lvl ~ gender + age + residence + income + edu_lvl + profession + household_size + dri_lic + num_cars + exp_lvl + self_drive + other_drive + pub_trans + bicycle + walking + tourist_envi + road_envi
sati_lvl ~ frequency_travel + daily_d

# Correlations

exp_lvl ~~ tourist_envi
ta_envi1 ~~ ta_envi2
ta_envi5 ~~ ta_envi6
'

# Fit the model
fit_sem <- sem(model, data = TBQT, estimator = "MLR", std.lv = TRUE, missing = "ml")
# case-wise (or ‘full information’) maximum likelihood estimation (setting ``) cannot be used if using "WLSMV" to treat the problem of categorical endogenous variales.

# Model summary
fitMeasures(fit_sem, c("rmsea", "cfi", "tli", "chisq", "df"))
sem_summary <- summary(fit_sem, fit.measures = TRUE, standardized = TRUE, modindices = TRUE)

mi <- modindices(fit_sem, sort = TRUE, maximum.number = 20)
```

As all of the variables in the model are categorical variables (either binary, categorical or ordinal), `lavaan` package only need to maintain the types of these categorical variables as `numeric` to deal with exogenous categorical variables. For endogenous variables, the ideal way is to set it as `ordered`, however, since the Full Information Maximum Likelihood method of dealing with missing value cannot deal with categorical variable. Therefore, I prioritized using Maximum Likelihood with Robust Standard Errors (MLR) estimator with setting `missing = "ml"` to deal with missing values. 

For iterations, as the iterations control is already built into the `lavaan` package, it will automatically iterate until convergence. Regarding bootstrapping strategy, it helps to deal with data non-normality problem and to test indirect effects by estimating bias-corrected confidence intervals (CI). This method should be tested with trials, yet due to time constraints, it is not included in this model paper.
