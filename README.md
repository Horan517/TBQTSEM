# TBQTSEM: model paper for the final course project

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This r project `TravelBehaviorQinghai` is created by first-year PhD
student [Haoran Xu](https://github.com/Horan517) to produce a model
paper for the final course project of [“GEOG712 - Reproducible Research
Workflow”](https://github.com/paezha/Reproducible-Research-Workflow/tree/master),
taught by [Dr. Antonio Paez](https://experts.mcmaster.ca/display/paezha)
at McMaster University, Canada.

The paper is titled “Assessing the influence of tourists’ perceived
travel environment and their travel behavior on travel satisfaction
using structural equation models (SEM): a case of Qinghai-Tibet
Plateau”, and stems from a half-way done research project in
collaboration with [Dr. Huaxiong
Jiang](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Huaxiong-Jiang-2157090528)
starting from Jun, 2022 from [Beijing Normal Universtiy,
China](https://english.bnu.edu.cn/). The project paused since March of
2023 due to lack of time and energy investment. Therefore, I am taking
the chance of this course project to review and re-arrange the previous
work I had done nearly two years ago. Main work I did for this course
project include:

- developing an r package using the existing dataset of Excel format,
  transforming it into reproducible, open-sourced, and well-cleaned .rda
  format dataset.
- using r package [lavaan](https://lavaan.ugent.be/) to reproduce the
  [Structural Equations
  Modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_equation_modeling)
  (SEM) method, which was previously constructed and performed with
  [mplus](https://www.statmodel.com/), a commercial software.
- writing a model article in r studio using latex syntax, practicing
  several r packages such as `tidyverse`, `kableExtra`, and `macdown`.
